"In this assignment we take a look at the KTH fishing derby game. The players in this game are two fishing boats out at sea (see Figure 1). Imagine that you are in command of the green boat (on the left) while the red one (on the right) is the opponent. The goal of the game is to get a higher score than the opponent, obtained through catching fish. The game is over either when there are no fish is left or the game time has passed." https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.ai.search
